Create a Travel Activity Bag\n\rPut together a small bag filled with activities like coloring books, crayons, puzzles, and stickers. For older kids, include travel-sized board games or card games like Uno.\n\r\n\r3. Download Educational and Fun Apps\n\rBefore your trip, download apps, audiobooks, or games on your phone or tablet that are both fun and educational. Make sure to also bring child-friendly headphones.\n\r\n\r4. Play Travel Games\n\rClassic games like “I Spy,” “20 Questions,” or “License Plate Bingo” can keep the whole family entertained on road trips or during waiting times at the airport.\n\r\n\r5. Bring Comfort Items\n\rDon’t forget to pack your child’s favorite comfort item, whether it’s a stuffed animal, blanket, or pillow. These familiar items can help ease travel anxiety.\n\r\n\r6. Audiobooks and Podcasts\n\rAudiobooks or kid-friendly podcasts are a great way to keep kids entertained without screens. Choose fun stories or educational topics they’re interested in.\n\r\n\r7. Give Them a Disposable Camera\n\rGiving older kids a disposable camera or an inexpensive digital camera can keep them occupied as they document the trip. It also adds an element of fun and creativity!\n\r\n\r8. Plan Frequent Breaks\n\rFor road trips, plan breaks every couple of hours to let kids stretch their legs, use the bathroom, and run around a bit. It helps break up the monotony of the trip.\n\r\n\r9.
