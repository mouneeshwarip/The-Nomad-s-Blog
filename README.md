<h2 id="colours">Colours</h2>

The color palette of Nomad's Blog predominantly features various shades of green, reflecting the project's commitment to celebrating nature and promoting a sense of peacefulness. Each hue is carefully selected to evoke feelings of tranquility and harmony, symbolizing our dedication to environmental awareness and the beauty of the natural world. This design choice not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the blog but also aligns with our mission to inspire wanderlust and appreciation for the great outdoors. The colors are  #rgb(34, 192, 118), #445261, #17c9a0, #188181.

<h2 id="media">Media</h2>

* All photographs used on the blog are from<a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank"> Pexels.com </a>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

<a href="#top">Back to the top.</a>


<h2 id="homepage">Homepage</h2>

<h2 id="navigation-desktop">Navigation Desktop</h2>

<a href="#top">Back to the top.</a>

* The site navigation is done through the navigation bar at the top of each page & this is consistant throughout the website.

* The navigation bar at the top of each page is sticky to allow access to the navigation at any time.

* Options on the navigation bar change depending on whether the user is logged in or not, or is an admin/staffuser or not.

<h2 id="post-details">Posts Details</h2>


<h2 id="Likes">Likes</h2>

The Like Posts feature has been introduced for registered users. Upon logging in, users can express their appreciation for their favorite posts by liking them.

When a user likes a post, the displayed number of likes is updated and increased by one. Additionally, users have the option to click the like button again to remove their like, which subsequently decreases the count.

This functionality effectively demonstrates CRED operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the website, enhancing user engagement and interaction with the content.

<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>

<a href="#top">Back to the top.</a>


## Heroku

The project was deployed via <a href="https://id.heroku.com/login" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, and the live link can be found here: <a href=" " target="_blank">The Nomad's Blog</a>

This project was developed utilising the <a href="https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template" target="_blank">Code Institute Template for Gitpod</a>.

Before deploying to Heroku pip3 freeze > requirements.txt was used to add all dependencies for deployment and created the Procfile with web: gunicorn cocktailnerd.wsgi.

Created .slugignore with /documentation, README.md & TESTING.md as paths to ignore in Heroku as I don't want the documentation to upload to Heroku.

This project was deployed to Heroku using the Heroku CLI details below

* Login
To use the CLI you must log in to your Heroku account. To do this you will need to
enter the command heroku login -i in the terminal. It requires the email and
password you used to sign up. If you have enabled multi-factor authentication (a
recommended security practice) then instead of your password you need an API key.
To get the API key go to your account settings and scroll down to the section â€˜API
Keyâ€™. Click reveal and copy that, then paste it into the password prompt.

* Creating A Heroku App
Now that you are logged in, the first thing is to create a new app. Heroku creates a
URL based on your app name, so it must be unique not only on your account, but
across the whole site. You may need to try a few different names. To create an app
use the following command, where myapp is the name of your app.

* Here the app heroku-cli-example has been created with an output of the website
URL. It also displays and sets the git remote repository which will be used to deploy.
By default the region will be set to the US. If you would prefer a server based in the
EU then you can specify the region with the flag EU

* When you push code to Heroku it will look at the repository contents to decide how
to build the project. One of the factors taken into consideration is the package file.
With a Python project the standard file is a requirements.txt file, which will have the
list of packages needed to run the project. If this file is present it will build the project
using the Python buildpack.

* It is also possible to specify the buildpack manually. More information about
buildpacks can be found in the documentation. To check the buildpack for the
project you can enter heroku buildpacks in the terminal.

## Deployment Steps On Heroku.

* Run this command pip3 install pip3 install 'django<4' to install django.
* Added these libraries:pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2,pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
* Created requirements.txt file where I can save all the libraries I've installed:pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
* To create my project typed this command:django-admin startproject cocktailnerd
* To create my app:python3 manage.py startapp cocktailapp
* To make this app work, Into the setting.py file inside INSTALLED_APPS added cocktailapp
* To migrate changes typed this command:python3 manage.py migrate
* To run the test if the project is working python3 manage.py runserver
* When deploying for the first time on Heroku, you must first register with Heroku.
* Create your project name and location.
* To add Database into the app, Locate in the Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add 'Heroku Postgres'
* Copy DATABASE_URL value, by going into the Settings Tab, click reveal Config Vars, Copy Text
* In your workspace Create new env.py file.
* Import os library:import os
* Set environment variables:os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Heroku DATABASE_URL"
* Add in secret key:os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "mysecretkey"
* Add Secret Key to Config Vars in Heroku settings:SECRET_KEY, "mysecretkey"
* Add env.py file to the settings.py file:import osimport dj_database_urlif os.path.isfile("env.py"):import env
* Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on Heroku:SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
* Comment out the old DATABASES variable in setting.py file and add this instead:DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}
* Save all files and Make Migrations:python3 manage.py migrate
* Make account with Cloudinary To get static and media files.
* From Cloudinary Dashboard, Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL:
* Add Cloudinary URL to env.py file:os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"
* Add Cloudinary URL to Heroku Config Vars:"cloudinary://************************"
* Temporalliy add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC inside the heroku config Vars:DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, 1
* Add Cloudinary Libraries to settings.py installed apps:INSTALLED_APPS = ['cloudinary_storage', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'cloudinary']
* In the settings.py file under the STATIC_URL = 'static/' add:

```python
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

```
* Place under the BASE_DIR line in settings.py:TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR Place within the TEMPLATES array:TEMPLATES = [{'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],}]
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS:ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["project4-cocktail-nerd.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]
* Create 3 new folders on the root directory: media, static, templates
* Create Procfile needed for Heroku on the root directory and inside the file add this:web: gunicorn dentist.wsgi
* Before deploying on heroku make sure: DEBUG = False Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from the config vars.
* Created .slugignore with /documentation, README.md & TESTING.md as I don't want the documentation to upload to Heroku.
* Click **Enable Automatic Deploys** for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github.
* Select the correct branch for deployment from the drop-down menu and click **Deploy Branch** for manual deployment.
